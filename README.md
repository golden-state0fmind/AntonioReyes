I am Antonio Reyes a Software Engineer with a passion for tech interested in learning more about tech and growing into more complex applications.

## Technologies used

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
BootStrap

## Approach

I wanted a clean user friendly website to host all my projects for friends and family to enjoy. Using vanilla JavaScript and some bootstrap I am inspired using the dark mode feature on the top right corner to help viewers see content thats easier on the eyes.
